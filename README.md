#CrystalDataFiles

This program is a console application and was developed for personal purposes
and in order to gain experience.

The main task of this program is:
 - Delete duplicate files in the specified directory
 - Provide a detailed report on deleted files and freed memory

The structure of the program is designed in such a way that its functionality
can be further expanded for other purposes using other hashing algorithms.

The algorithm used in this program is SHA-256

ATTENTION: At the moment, the program permanently deletes files!
In the future, it is planned to provide the option to delete files.

Reporting on deleted files is saved in the "report" folder at the root of the project.

Program version 1.0 on 11.11.2024
